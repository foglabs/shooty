  when timer ends, kill highlighted enemy

  press casino button to start

  some numbers win, some lose
  if win, kill number * 




shrapnel






*tighten player control
*need visual for corruption about to happen
change friend hitcolor 


*-invisible corrupted enemies? wtf
?-chohan percent prob



*-reduce corruptingTime with higher rounds
*-push down #enemies curve with higher rounds, gets too hard to killi them all

-purple super evil corrupteds, chase you, maybe get big?

-big is another type (giant)
-add sprite for yellow cirlce guys, too hard to see


-add a few 菓子 to beginning of each round
-slightly increase smaller keybumpb




still need to sort scores




add fog labs logo







-sword should change rotate when its not out

-kev
  hitting the wall too much
  slow the top speed 









*-spend energy to drop smokes
*-spend energy to drop bombs
*-dont recover energy from enemies killed with killing circle
  wasnt

-fix play again





-need to track all sprites in some global way, too much getting disconnected from dead character when mode changes
  trask all when they first show up... clear periodically?
  cant expect them to have the time to fade, AND catch all edge cases of mode changes
  *or who cares ^

-instead of sprite attached to character, make it its own thing -> character gone, sprite keeps getting handled

-double check bens friend health bug
-add maximum sword length
-exponential power usage for sword -> bigger, more damage, but more expensive

-possibly add hitman or green giant bad guys?

  -enemie start to have swords






after x level all enemies have swords
e swords get longer with roundcount

enemies with smokes/bombs?
  maybe at least one other thing that enemies get
  whirling dervish saw?



player sword gets longer with level, reasonable maximum
by p level 32(?) sword takes enough power to drain bar qucikly

add green giant enemies
  add 'grunt' kill sounds


add hitman enemies
  big hitt, gold chain BLEENG

  another corrupted type after round 30(?)
