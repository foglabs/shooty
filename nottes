knowledge accumulates from killin a certain guy

filling knowledge bar unlocks a new corruptor-kill power




-make health cube and knowledge guy more rare
-corrupteds do more damage the higher round you're in
add other powiz at higher levles



-need a little more time in higher rounds, enemy count is good
-






-friend
-slash from player
-evil bits
-killer text





*casino
  roulette
  set timer
  light up enemies at random one by one
  when timer ends, kill highlighted enemy

  press casino button to start
  press again to increase bet (power)
    highlight more enemies with higher bet
  after 3s, roll dice
    cycle through 
  some numbers win, some lose
  if win, kill number * 




shrapnel






*tighten player control
*need visual for corruption about to happen
change friend hitcolor 


*-invisible corrupted enemies? wtf
?-chohan percent prob



*-reduce corruptingTime with higher rounds
*-push down #enemies curve with higher rounds, gets too hard to killi them all

-purple super evil corrupteds, chase you, maybe get big?

-big is another type (giant)
-add sprite for yellow cirlce guys, too hard to see


-add a few 菓子 to beginning of each round
-slightly increase smaller keybumpb




still need to sort scores




add fog labs logo







-sword should change rotate when its not out
-pj wants more distinct color

-kev
  hitting the wall too much
  slow the top speed 









*-spend energy to drop smokes
*-spend energy to drop bombs
*-dont recover energy from enemies killed with killing circle
  wasnt

-fix play again





-need to track all sprites in some global way, too much getting disconnected from dead character when mode changes
  trask all when they first show up... clear periodically?
  cant expect them to have the time to fade, AND catch all edge cases of mode changes
  *or who cares ^

-instead of sprite attached to character, make it its own thing -> character gone, sprite keeps getting handled

-double check bens friend health bug
-add maximum sword length
-exponential power usage for sword -> bigger, more damage, but more expensive

-possibly add hitman or green giant bad guys?

  -enemie start to have swords






after x level all enemies have swords
e swords get longer with roundcount

enemies with smokes/bombs?
  maybe at least one other thing that enemies get
  whirling dervish saw?



player sword gets longer with level, reasonable maximum
by p level 32(?) sword takes enough power to drain bar qucikly

add green giant enemies
  add 'grunt' kill sounds


add hitman enemies
  big hitt, gold chain BLEENG

  another corrupted type after round 30(?)


  spawns with a $x contract on player's life

  if has fromEnemy contract
    pursues player
    hurts player
    at speed determined by remaining money
    money spends down each second or whatever

  if has fromPlayer contract
    pursues random enemy
    hurts all enemies
    at speed determined by remaining money
    money spends down each second or whatever

  if no contract
    wanders
    if player touches (eat) and has money, start fromPlayer contract
    if enemy touches and has money, start fromPlayer contract

  eats shoots and leaves
    shoots your (contract target) bich ass
    sends bullets to target's position?


  black/gray lookin enemy
    toon shade?

  enemies generate ~1$ a second or something
  player gets x$ per level up/ y$ per boss kill and can earn money in casino!



new stuff
-=-=-=-=

corruption sounds
  one for each type
  killed and attack sounds for each type

materials
  get some real materials ya fool


*-mkae purple eat sound

*-every 5 rounds, spotlight2 gets changed to diff color
-toon shade explosions


FIX DIS
-=-=-=-===
*-by round 31, there are 0 knowloctas
  eventually only sticks

  try shallow scale > round 20


-pattern move doesnt work properly for sticks

*-sword stays out if you hold sword down, even after energy depleted
  
-add 'merchant' enemy, buy stuff with money
  screen clear
  health
  knowl

  player gets faster for a minute






*-caught with no energy against 2 godcorrupted
  just have to wait out the timer
  this sucks

  presword problem
    you dont know to guide to bombs
    if you do, you might get stuck doing it an infinite # of times before purps show up

    only make you do it once
      give purps to get you to sword?



  -slowly regen 1 e/s during post-sword 'avoid the bombs scenario'





-healcube sparklies dont get cleared from cleangame


mo money mo problems
  more player money faster corrupted pursuits?


speedpower too fast
  yellow not red

merchant
  *met cost ADDs money


they complainin about these items
  *cheaper items only at lower rounds



dragcoefficient is how much to slow down by
lightness is scale on a movement amount (higher means lighter, more than 1 *adds* to movement amount)
keyheat scales up acc change

hit the wall, get dmg bonus
full speed, get a dmg bons


*show next enemies coming in from background
*player too sluggish


*last enemy (or sometimes few enemies) getting wiped for some reason
  only sometimes ??
*make corrupteds always chase yhou on round 20+
*increase player bbox?
*check bonus damage amount
*make topspeed bubble pulsate or glow
*on dmg, deform enemies
*halve timers because of plane enemies
*psword is fucking broken
*increase sword bbxo by player amount
*fix bottom right of glow png
*randombombing is broken when enemies are behind






*too many purples at high rounds?  
*smokes not cleaned after player death

controllers have different scales of inputs
  may need calibration routine to go with button mapping !! ! 

*save controller map to cookie!



*lower godcorrupt dmg at earlier rounds? for sword
*longer smoke/bomb regen time, too much spam with 3+
*lower threshold for top speed bonus dmg to be easier

*still too many knowls?!
  level too easy to get, easy to get to 20k
*speed item drops your top speed v low when it wears off, below where youstarted







*no 'please calibrate message' when swithc to stick calibrate
*need to clean up killing circle frmo demo

*visual confirmation of topspeed damage


*greencorrupt health regen is too much? very hard to kill with kc now

  test!

*add 'max num simultaneous enemies' for each round so you cant sit there to beef up



*'only corrupteds in front of entryplane' doenst always work, seems to stop after killing one corrupted also
  2 corrupts, % == 1
  kill 1 % == 2
